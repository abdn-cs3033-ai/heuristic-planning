    "\n",
    "**Prof. Felipe Meneguzzi**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (CS3033):\n",
    "- Assigned: Week 13\n",
    "- Due: Week 18 (Monday 9am)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "<img align=\"right\" src=\"planning-assignment.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this work is to implement the core functions of an automated planner and benchmark a number of heuristics. You will implement three main functions in this assignment:\n",
    "- Implement the **Max-Cost** ($h^{max}$) heuristic function.\n",
    "- Implement a function capable of validating a plan given a domain and a problem.\n",
    "- Finally, implement the heuristic search **A\\***\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing the required functions, you must write a 2-page paper. The entire package must be delivered using GitHub: your implemented functions must be contained in this Jupyter Notebook, and the paper as a separate **pdf** file committed in the same Github repository in the ```paper``` folder. Your implementation *must not depend on any additional libraries* beyond the standard Python distribution for Python 3.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can test your implementation with the provided domains and problems:\n",
    "  - [blocksworld](examples/blocksworld)\n",
    "  - [dinner](examples/dinner)\n",
    "  - [dwr](examples/dwr)\n",
    "  - [tsp](examples/tsp)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Planning tools and extra domains and problems to sanity check your own implementation:\n",
    "  - [Web-Planner](https://web-planner.herokuapp.com/)\n",
    "  - [editor.planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains/)\n",
    "  - IPC domains and problems can be found in [potassco/pddl-instances](https://github.com/potassco/pddl-instances)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to properly evaluate your work and thought process, you will write a **2-page** report in the AAAI two-column format explaining your encoding and experiments. \n",
    "These guidelines are to be followed **exactly**. \n",
    "**Reports that are less than two pages of actual content, or not in format will receive 0 marks for the report criterion.** \n",
    "This report will be included in the deliverables of the assignment. \n",
    "[The formatting instructions are available at Overleaf (AAAI Press)](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/aaai-press-latex-template/jymjdgdpdmxp). \n",
    "The report must have the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An introduction with your understanding of the problem domain, outlining the remainder of the paper;\n",
    "- Three sections explaining each part of your implementation (search, heuristic, and validator).\n",
    "- An experimentation section where you measure the performance of the planner using the supplied [problem domains](examples), along with any action formalisation you create, on multiple problems The [Benchmarking](#benchmark-heuristic-function-optional) section of this notebook contains useful code to generate nice figures for this section. \n",
    "- One conclusion section, where you will summarise your experience in encoding planning domains and discuss the performance of the planner, and any limitations encountered in solving the problems you encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading will consider elements of your encoding, experimentation, and reporting of the work done. \n",
    "The criteria, as well as their weight in the final grade is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementation (70%):\n",
    "  - Heuristic function (20%);\n",
    "  - Validator (20%);\n",
    "  - Heuristic search (30%):\n",
    "      - Correctness and optimality (20%); and\n",
    "      - Runtime efficiency (10%).\n",
    "- Overall report readability (20%) — how accessible and coherent your explanation of your implementation is;\n",
    "- Code readability (10%).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Corrections:** From time to time, students or staff find errors (e.g., typos, unclear instructions, etc.) in the assignment specification. In that case, a corrected version of this file will be produced, announced, and distributed for you to commit and push into your repository. Because of that, you are NOT to modify the README.md file in any way to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions & extensions:** You have a 24 hour grace period with a penalty of 10% of the maximum mark, which increases to 50% until 48 hours after the due date, and 100% penalty thereafter. Extensions will only be permitted in _exceptional_ circumstances. \n",
    "\n",
    "**About this repo:** You must ALWAYS keep your fork private and never share it with anybody in or outside the course, even after the course is completed. You are not allowed to make another repository copy outside the provided GitHub Classroom without the written permission of the teaching staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_Please do not distribute or post solutions to any of the projects and notebooks._**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaboration Policy:** You must work on this project **individually**. \n",
    "You are free to discuss high-level design issues with the people in your class, but every aspect of your actual formalisation must be entirely your own work.\n",
    "Furthermore, there can be no textual similarities in the reports written by each student. \n",
    "Plagiarism, no matter the degree, will result in forfeiture of the entire grade of this assignment. \n",
    "Do not use any **generative AI models** (e.g., Co-Pilot, ChatGPT, etc) to write any portion of your code, as this constitutes plagiarism. \n",
    "\n",
    "**We are here to help!:** We are here to help you! But we don't know you need help unless you tell us. We expect reasonable effort from you side, but if you get stuck or have doubts, please seek help by creating an issue in the repository and assigning it to the instructor. Always keep the most updated version of your code pushed to Git so when you create an issue, the teaching staff can look into your code to help. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Silence Policy:** A silence policy will take effect **48 hours** before this assignment is due. This means that no question about this assignment will be answered, whether it is asked on Moodle, by email, or in person. Use the last 48 hours to wrap up and finish your project quietly as well as possible if you have not done so already. Remember it is not mandatory to do all perfect, try to cover as much as possible. By having some silence we reduce anxiety, last minute mistakes, and unreasonable expectations on others. \n",

The validator must return **True** if and only if the given plan is applicable and reaches the specified goal, and **False** if the plan itself is **not** applicable **or**  the given plan does **not** achieve the specified goal. Your code must be contained in the ```validate(self, actions, initial_state, goals, plan)``` function in the cell below. You can create additional functions (do not forget to comment the code intelligibly). Validate takes the following inputs:\n",
    "- ``actions``: list of ground actions\n",
    "- ``initial_state``: initial state of the problem file\n",
    "- ``goals``: tuple with (positive predicates, negative predicates) of the goal\n",

Plan contains $[o_1, o_2, \\dots, o_n]$, such that $pre(o_1) = \\{ \\}$ (empty set) and $eff(o_1) = \\{\\}$. For each $o_i$ in ``plan`` you need to find an $a_j$ in ``actions`` such that $name(o_i) = name(a_j)$ and $parameters(o_i) = parameters(a_j)$. The validator should generate the states $[s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_n]$ such that $s_1 = apply(s_1, a_j)$ where $a_j$ matches $o_1$, and so on until you generate an $s_n$ that supports the goal (i.e. $s_n \\models goal$)."
