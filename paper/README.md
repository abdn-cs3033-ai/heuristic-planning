# Assessment Report

Your assessment report, formatted using the [AAAI paper style](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/aaai-press-latex-template/jymjdgdpdmxp) goes in this folder as [PDF file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF "Remember, **do not use Word**"). Recall that there is a prescriptive structure for your report:

- Section 1: An introduction with your understanding of the problem domain, outlining the remainder of the paper;
- Section 2: Three subsections explaining each part of your implementation (search, heuristic, and validator).
- Section 3: An experimentation section where you measure the performance of the planner using the supplied [problem domains](../examples), along with any action formalisation you create, on multiple problems.
- Section 4: One conclusion section, where you will summarise your experience in encoding planning domains and discuss the performance of the planner, and any limitations encountered in solving the problems you encoded.
